# TriviaGame

This was a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class and uses a combination of everything learned to date (html, css, javascript, jquery, DOM manipulation...)

## How to play:

* This is a trivia game on 80's movies.  Most of these were not top box office movies.

* The player will be given the question and four options to choose from.

* The player will have a limited amount of time to answer the question. 

* The game ends when there are no more questions. The page will reveal the number of questions that the player answered correctly, incorrectly, or did not answer in time.
